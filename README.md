# Volvo-Auto-Price-Research

A Swedish automobile company Volvo Auto aspires to enter the Nigerian market by setting up its manufacturing unit and producing cars locally to compete with their Nigerian, US and European counterparts. They have contacted me as a Data Scientist to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the Nigerian market, since those may be very different from the Swedish market.

The company wants to know:

● Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car.

● How well do those variables describe the price of a car.

Based on various market surveys, I have gathered a large data set of different types of cars across the Nigerian market.
